This code is designed to create extremely strong passwords or transform normal words into strong passwords.
The 'generate()' function creates an 18 character long password, or the specified length from random characters.
The 'conversion()' function takes a text input, such as a word you are familiar with, and converts into a stronger password by adding capitals, symbols, and numbers. It also converts some common letters into look-alike characters, randomly. Most words go from being 'weak' to 'strong' with a password strength checker. In changing the amount of integers and symbols wanted, or the length of the input you can control the strength more.
